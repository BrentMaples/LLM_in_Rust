# LLM_in_Rust
I have long been a programmer of Python and find myself implementing many of my machine learning tasks in this language. However, in recent times I have found that Rust is a great companion of Python and may help improve my performances in Python. The objective of this repository is to record what I have implemented in my LLM journey.
